Needed to complete a packet capture on a host but didnâ€™t have time or approval to install Wireshark. 
To complete a capture, netsh was utilised using the following steps:

1) For a remote session, (Skip step if using RDP)

-	Open a command prompt as an Admin account.
-	Run psexec (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)

!
psexec \\[hostname] cmd
!


2) Go to directory where your account has write permissions

!
cd c:\data
!

3) Initiate a capture

!
netsh trace start persistent=yes capture=yes tracefile=c:\data\nettrace-boot.etl
!

Trace configuration:

#Stop a capture 

!
netsc trace stop
!

C:\WINDOWS\system32>netsh trace stop

4) # Copy file to your workstation 
5) # Open file using Microsoft Message Analyzer (https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=44226)

Note: Microsoft Message Analyzer is a bit average.
